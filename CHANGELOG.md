## 2026-06-24 — Claude — Added Excel (.xlsx) export/import

- `⬇ XLSX` button in header exports a workbook with four human-readable sheets (Environment, RAID, Migration, Network) plus a hidden `_data` sheet containing the v4 JSON blob for round-trip import
- Import button now accepts `.txt` and `.xlsx`; detects file type and routes to the correct handler; `.xlsx` import reads the `_data` sheet and calls `raidApplyImport()` to repopulate all calculators
- SheetJS 0.18.5 loaded via CDN; existing `.txt` and PDF export/import unchanged

## 2026-06-24 10:03 — Codex — Refresh Environment as a live capacity dashboard

- Reworked the Environment layout into a compact server-profile and VM-workload workspace with clearer hierarchy, spacing, focus states, and responsive behaviour
- Added a sticky live Capacity Summary for CPU, memory, storage, fit status, and the optimal recommended host specification
- Preserved the existing calculation, export, import, licensing, RAID, migration, and network logic; JavaScript syntax and dashboard ID bindings validated
